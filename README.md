### **Contributors:** Aditi Khanna, Ariane Taraki, Erik Ly

## **Name of the system**
This overall system, Hate Speech Detection, consists of several parts: a ```/Data``` directory with parsed tweets to be used for modeling, and a ```/Code``` directory containing three separate directories for the Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression models each.

## **Short description of the problem solved**
The problem that our system attempts to tackle is detecting hate speech (specifically racism and sexism) in tweets. Our system parses tweets containing hate speech, taken from the Twitter API, and trains three different Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear Regression) to detect the hate speech using this data.

## **Short description on how to run your code**
In order to run our system, first run tweetscript.py to get the hate speech data, then run each ML model individually in their respective directories, to get resulting performance data.
