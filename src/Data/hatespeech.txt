@tsupdawgs @feministlah I'll take any screen grabs you have.  Thanks.
@amberhasalamb  Separate conversations.  She told a guy concerned about circumcision that he can't get laid.  Exactly what she whined about.
@hayleyjoness @Fatboyisangry1 That is feminism's doing, you realize?
@hayleyjoness Why do you judge on genitals, rather than merit?  If a man works in an 80% female workplace, should he cry discrimination?
@feministlah @GreenWeiner No.  Valid point.  I have never actually seen an MRA say he hates women (openly) like #KillAllMen etc.
@hayleyjoness Curious...do you know what the 23% (pay gap) figure refers to?  Do you know how it was derived?
@feministlah @GreenWeiner No True Scotsman.
@feministlah @GreenWeiner ...who are mislabeled.
@hayleyjoness YW...?  Well, if you know that men and women do different jobs, why WOULD the pay be the same?
RT @thesledgetobias: @MT8_9 @amberhasalamb My god, so it truly is a projection.
@hayleyjoness ...as a result there is a POSSIBLE supply of 100% of the population for all "female" jobs vs. maybe 20% for some "male" jobs.
@feministlah @GreenWeiner Women have more legal rights in every Western nation.  Who is privileged?
@feministlah @GreenWeiner So feminism is NOT about equal rights, but a socio/polital movement?
.@feministlah @GreenWeiner Way way more than one...and why not...that's how they arrive at "male privilege"? #AntiSJW http://t.co/LmPvPJvsyx

@GemmaNoon it's what i'm *trying* to do, at least targeting specific groups/causes. it's tricky. have to look more at statistics than words.
@GemmaNoon ie: things not as open for interpretation, such as numeric or boolean data (is following/is not following, etc).
@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests, GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers

Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past.
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients.
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch).
does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse.
in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect.
don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like "WHAT A GREAT IDEA" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3
@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P
@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?
@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.
take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed &amp; threatened.
so, my yammering sleazeball cupcakes, you can go with http://t.co/TDToqiuQDc and i'll go my way.

I fight for the users.
@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...
@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad.
i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose.
@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.
@dylanw last i checked, baldwin was verified.
@tomdcc you can only have one GV # per acct at any given time.

@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded.
@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category.
@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals.
@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target.
@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment.
@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.
@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US, but we're also far removed from the class it would impact.
@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.
@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have
@limbclock i wouldn't do that.
@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?
@GlennF @Spacekatgal i read it only because i already knew what it was going to say. he's not a creative thinker.
@GlennF @Spacekatgal he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before. they were bad then, shockingly, still bad now.
@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean, unless you are becoming verified.
@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.
@sschinke @teh_maxh as a guess, anyways.
Oh god. I am so stubborn.

Just realized the only thing it took to push me off the fence in the real name/pseudonym debate was jason/wadhwa.

@a_man_in_black WELL ACTUALLY I'm kiiiiiiiinda a rainbow haired expert.
@a_man_in_black in all seriousness, i've been dying my hair since my teens. I can't remember the last time I used a single shade. Too flat.
@ElisaRockDoc works well for some colors. the pastels are gorgeous but fade SUPER quickly. the blues are amazing.
@milfgaardian Depends on shade. When doing blues, most MP fades out greyish blue, most SFX fades out w/green tint.
@milfgaardian I usually mix brands depending on how they fade. SFX has fantastic pinks, though. N'Rage does some decent pinks, too.
@a_man_in_black gross. i'd look weird with no hair.
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana?
@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.
@milfgaardian it's relatively new. most salons have switched to using it here instead of specialfx.
@milfgaardian (brb, am starting to feel feelings in my scalp, that means it's time to wash this stuff out.)
@milfgaardian not sure. i kind of like when it fades on short hair, if it's dyed well. it's less monotone.
@milfgaardian check it - https://t.co/BCdYXQzAm7
@milfgaardian pravana vivids are my favorite line for blues, easily. pastels line is gorgeous, but fades SO quick. days to weeks.

Most tellingly of all, hashtag + target mentions are up. @spacekatgal has received 474 mentions in the past 12 hours w/gamergate ht.
She seems to be getting the most tweets, but @femfreq and @TheQuinnspiracy have seen much more ht engagement as well.
Important to note in ALL of these stats, my 'before' is taken from a large timespan. 'after' has been the past 12 h, typically a slow time.
Even my own gg ht mentions are way up. I'm guessing because of the keynote yesterday.
Typically mine are fairly low. They dropped especially when they realized I wasn't bothering to engage many blocked users.
@AGoodHusband @ArsVampyre harassing and doxxing prevent free speech. they are an attempt to silence their targets.
@AGoodHusband @ArsVampyre however, despite what they want everyone to believe, speaking out about your experiences isn't "harassing" GG.
@JonHelfrich oh, they do. but they use nicknames, or my real names. not mentions.

@coil780 he helped start all of this. he came up with the hashtag.
I am now watching wadhwa be "very disappointed" in the EFF. Jesus. Is that his standard line for every male that doesn't agree with him?
Now that the world is starting to see him for what he is, he must be living in a perpetual cloud of disappointment. #stopwadhwa2015
@tobypinder @coil780 nope! very first night, he engaged me with those pics. that dude is just ridic.

@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall It read to me like you like him bcz he supports yr book
.@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall when ur writing a book about WiT, it is prob not a good idea to do this.
a reminder - RTs are not endorsements.
RT @hypatiadotca: @tarah well, let me tell you how this looks: throwing another woman under the bus to suck up to a shitty dude while also …
@hypatiadotca a million times this.
@hypatiadotca @tarah I agree 100% with this statement.
@BajaLime I'm back in June ;)
@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall uh. And anyone that disagrees is crazy or attention seeking,

@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall I would rather deal with an MRA than wadhwa.
@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall he's a weasel. You fell for it. You're throwing *me* under the bus.
@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall well, you have his support, but you just lost mine.
@tarah @girlziplocked @hypatiadotca @justkelly_ok @ameliagreenhall still a sellout. still unacceptable and disgusting.

@Firebomb173 @ANDAASONSAN sometimes, the bot comes up with combinations of words that are undesirable.
@Firebomb173 @ANDAASONSAN not the first time it's happened. That was probably the worst though.
It's difficult deciding to call out something as being problematic, because that gives it attention &amp; not many people know about it.
There's a woman writing a "women in tech" book. And she's stomping on everyone in her path as long as she gets money for it.
She's buddying up with wadhwa, because he endorsed her book. She's friends with weev, who targeted *so many* women in tech.
She wants the attention. She's admitted she's a "sellout". But a lot of good women are helping her write this book.
@scoutsaber yes.

Dehydrated vaginas - I mean pears - for breakfast. http://t.co/JTRMHHTMTj
@cxarli i care that she wrote a medium piece throwing all of us under the bus.
Tarah Wheeler Van Vlack threw a bunch of women under the bus so she could get Wadhwa's support for her Women in Tech book.
She's friends with weev, an actual neo-nazi that has harassed and driven women like Kathy Sierra out of the industry.
She's trying to play it as "we can have our own opinions but I still respect you" - No. She doesn't. She admitted that she was selling out.
She also claimed that women being angry with Wadhwa was worse than the death threats we were getting because we're "used to it".
So I implore you to not support any of her projects. If you've already contributed towards her book, pull out. This is horrible.

THIS IS THE FUNNIEST JOKE. @el_mago_oskuro @_RogueSt4r @Ethelmonster
If you're looking for a monitor arm, this one is pretty inexpensive and works well. http://t.co/B1B4Q6ycDd
If I change the tilt of my 27" ASUS all that much, I have to tighten the bolt of the arm, but it's easy to get to. My 24" isn't as heavy.
@mwlauthor now it worked. weeeeird. i tried 3 times.
@Krynis yeah, I needed something that mounted directly to my desk. I get bored and move furniture sometimes. :)
@ijosborne that's the same one i linked. :P
@ijosborne haha, i've got three. :) not sure if the 6 arm version is as good. i've only tested the single arms
RT @mwlauthor: The #BSDCan committee is discussing papers fast &amp; furious. I'm guessing we'll be late. So much good stuff this year!
RT @mwlauthor: #BSDCan has three proposals from women. All are good. Two of them kick hard-core kernel buttock.
@KirinDave huh. the monitor arm gave you problems?
@KirinDave holy crap. i've got 2 of them so far. just ordered a third. i've been pretty happy so far.
@KirinDave how big/heavy? i've got a 24" asus, 27" asus, 2nd 27" asus is on the way.
It is great to hear that there's more women getting involved with #FreeBSD. :) The community is fantastic and has always been supportive.
@KirinDave not bad. sad that i just ordered my new ASUS yesterday. :P
@KirinDave I was only able to afford it because I had to RMA another monitor. Sadly, tech toys are now out of my budget.
I have faith in the project, but more awareness needs to be spread about the difficulties and harassment that many female FOSS devs face.
@mwlauthor huh?
@KirinDave it's going to be an NPO, so I'll never get rich off of it. :P  The goal is just to make enough to live comfortably.
@mwlauthor oh. hahaha. i suspect it's because i type really fast. new keyboard and all. :P
@mwlauthor i've also got my phone docked next to my computer. It throws up a notification for DMs. I use the web interface on my PC to send.
@petrillic Jira continues to be a good choice if you're using other atlassian products. Everything is shit. It's less shit.
@mwlauthor i've mentioned before about how i bleed twitter json. i could probably construct an API call's return value by hand at this point
@Krynis I was able to do so without a problem. :P But I have pretty strong arms. 27" monitor is a lot lighter than the dumbbells I use. :P

this is the same company that SU bragged about when wadhwa joined them. this lawsuit happened *years* before SU.

Sipping coffee, pulling down follower list, running analytics against each of them to create a troll score.
With 500 user tokens, it shouldn't take long. Oh, darlings. I'm scared of no army. I've got an app for that.
@1Life0Continues a number of variables. :)  i've only run it against a small subset of accounts. it's fairly intensive. still in beta.
@1Life0Continues follower vs following ratio, acct date, profile image, entities used (hashtags, urls), users mentioned, OC vs RT %
@1Life0Continues users you're following along with their troll score plays a factor. users you RT, % of tweets that are sea lioning
@FrankAlvarez see this thread. :P https://t.co/VHThRdRIYr
No, I'm not telling anyone what their score is. Then it'll just turn into a contest for GamerGate to try to 'win'.
See https://t.co/VHThRdRIYr thread for more info on how this is quantified.
@1Life0Continues part of the reason i'm not actively using it that much is because the weights of each factor are still being decided.
@1Life0Continues i've got the code to interpret &amp; analyze, but the weights themselves are going to take a lot of fiddling.
@1Life0Continues this is basically going to be like antispam, but for tweets. :P

@markemer I love perl, but I think I'm starting to shift towards ruby. gem is nice. docs are horrid. need to read more about classes.
@markemer ruby seems like it would have a lot of stuff that you don't *have* to learn. so i can write code in it, but far to go.
