So Drasko just said he was impressed the girls cooked half a chicken.. They cooked a whole one  #MKR
Drasko they didn't cook half a bird you idiot #mkr
Hopefully someone cooks Drasko in the next ep of #MKR
of course you were born in serbia...you're as fucked as A Serbian Film #MKR
These girls are the equivalent of the irritating Asian girls a couple years ago. Well done, 7. #MKR

Pete and Manu like it. Stfu Kat. You are gross. #mkr #mykitchenrules
Why do the ugly hearted and untalented people always thrive on #mkr. Kat and Andre should've gone home. Such bitter assholes #mykitchenrules
Voting strategically on #mkr is one of the lowest things you can do. You're sitting bottom of the redemption round, clearly not going to win

I'm so glad all the instant restaurants are done and Colin is back! Was getting bored #mkr
@mykitchenrules Well, I was under the illusion that this show was about cooking. Turns out its just about who can be the biggest bitch. #mkr
@australiacamper Yep, same. But it's also wrong of #Mkr to let them get away with it. #mkr2015

RT @herbie_amy: At least we have one WA team we can be proud of! Go #EvaandDebra! #MKR #SpiceGirls #GirlPower 
#KatandAndre just shhhh, sto…
Maybe if Kat and Andre spent as much time focusing on cooking rather than strategy they'd actually do well  ... #MKR
Glad I can get back to my life now the fun part of #mkr is over and the faux Masterchef part has started.
FFS last year WA had Chloe &amp; Kelly and now we have Kat &amp; Andre. Channel 7 doesn't like Perth haha! #mkr
Kat your sour face is repulsive. #mkr #mykitchenrules
Is #mkr turning into #masterchef
What genius thought that letting teams score their competition was a good idea? Playing really dirty. #MKR
RT @PatriceChienne: I honestly think Kat has mental health issues. #mkr
She is such a bee eye tea see H!!! #mkr #feistyfoodies
Colin's back #MKR
Kat and Andre are bad representatives of Perth. Non WA's, I promise most people in Perth are more like Eva &amp; Debra! #mkr
no data
Even if Kat &amp; Andre gave them the 3 they wanted they still would be there and the blondies still woulda gone home #MKR
Not really a fan of #katieandnikki but would've rather they stayed than #katandandre #mkr
couldn't feel more different about the 2 WA teams. proud as punch of Eva &amp; Debra... just want to punch Kat &amp; Andre. pair of fucktards. #mkr

That's fucking low.. You two are pathetic! #mkr
Why don't you just give them a 0 and shut the fuck up #mkr
If you have to score strategically low to stay in the comp means you can't cook #mkr #feistyfoodies
Jelly much, Kat? Andre is no catch.  #mkr
Can Kat and Andre shut the fuck up like how selfish are you #MKR
JFC Kat do you have NO morals???? Carnt #mkr2015 #mkr

Tough words, Pete, from someone whose Paleo Cook Book for babies was just pulled due to the possibility of under-nourished babies. #MKR

I'm tempted to give them a ten given their chicken liver entree might help to kill babies.

So Kat and Andre from #mkr just leave a bad taste in your mouth. Very poor losers that's for sure.
I think I'd rather slightly over cooked pork chop than dishwater fish soup #mkr #FailedFoodies
